# Terminal-Ape
Started this project to (re)learn my coding skills in C# and coding in general, wanted to create a bot that buys newly listed coins on given exchanges (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase..). Step by step I'm figuring out new features and ideas for this app/project. Wish to make some kind of Terminal for Trading, automatically managing your portfolio etc.
